building and deploying the server.

NEW COMMIT:
- update the default.nix:
  1) with the new commit from git.  invalidate the sha256 hash so it won't just use the 
previous one without building.  
  2) if the cargo toml or lock has changed, then change the cargo hash.  otherwise leave it.

- build the package, with /build.sh.

./build.sh

- use the path in nix-copy-closure:

nix-copy-closure --to root@zknotes.com /nix/store/9v77vwy5zzv38mvh5a93yk02h2y94xq8-zknotes-server-1.0

- then on the server remove the old one (user practica2)

nix-env -e zknotes-server

- and install the new one by path name.

nix-env -i /nix/store/9v77vwy5zzv38mvh5a93yk02h2y94xq8-zknotes-server-1.0

- and then collect garbage to remove the old package.

nix-collect-garbage

- currently I'm not including any config or static files with the server.  copy up as needed!  
elm deploy is over in the elm folder, ../elm
